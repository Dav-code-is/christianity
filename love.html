    <h1>The Love of Christ</h1>
    <p>
        The love of Christ is a central theme in Christianity, representing the selfless, sacrificial, and unconditional love that Jesus has for all humanity. This love is not only demonstrated through His teachings but also through His actions, especially His sacrifice on the cross.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends." <br>
        <strong>— John 15:13 (NIV)</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Jesus’ love is inclusive and boundless. He reached out to the marginalized, healed the sick, and forgave sinners. His compassion was evident in every interaction, teaching us to love others as He loves us.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another." <br>
        <strong>— John 13:34 (NIV)</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The Apostle Paul reminds us that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. This assurance gives believers hope and strength, even in difficult times.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers... will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." <br>
        <strong>— Romans 8:38-39 (NIV)</strong>
    </blockquote>
